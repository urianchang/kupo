            We met each other in a small seminar class in the fall quarter of our freshman year at UCLA. The class, called “What is Time,” opened our eyes to how many different ways time can be tracked and measured. It can be counted by the number of steps that we took during our first chat along Bruin Walk back to the dorms. It can be measured by the distances that we have traveled to be together when we lived cities apart and by those that we have taken together on our adventures across the seas. It can be seen by the wrinkles around our eyes from smiling so much. It can be heard in the laughter with our friends and family as we reminisce. It can be felt in our growing pains as we learned how to say good-bye to our furry friends. It can be tasted in Urian’s cooking from being bland to being more flavorful like Angela's. From how often we forget how long we have been together to how often we dream and make plans for tomorrow, we have been keeping time by collecting fond memories.

            We would love to celebrate our marriage with you, our family and friends, because each of you have made an impact on our lives; and without you, we wouldn't be where we are today. From here to there, let us fly with time and make some happy memories.
